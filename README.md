# Comp 584 Couse Proj

As primary assignment for this class you will build an advanced Web application. The required components of the applications are the following:

Single Page Application (SPA)
Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) *
Authentication
Deployment
* Your application should include at least two tables with one-to-many relationship between them.

Fulfilling these requirements will make B grade.

We are going to build this application throughout the class. I recommend using ASP.NET/C# on the server and Angular on the client. However, for extra challenge (and extra credit) you can use other options, like Java on the server and/or React on the client.

Other ways to get to A are the following:

Authorization
Data Entry
Server-initiated communications (e.g., SignalR)
Unit Testing
Third-party Identity Providers (e.g., Okta/Auth0)
